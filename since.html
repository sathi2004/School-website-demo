            BSc or Bachelor of Science is an undergraduate degree of three years duration which is universally offered across institutes and universities across India. BSc is one of the most popular courses opted for by students who have a flair for scientific aptitude and zeal for research-oriented and calculative approaches based on a proven systematic method. Science is all about experimentation, research and discovery. A BSc degree is a culmination of both theoretical and practical ways of learning. Pursuing a BSc degree also opens up multiple avenues for a student and he/she can either opt for higher studies in Science or any other discipline which may be related to or different from the subjects studied during graduation. However, a Master of Science (MSc) is the most popular higher education alternative opted for by students after completing BSc.
            <h3>BSc Course Highlights</h3>
            The three-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science (BSc Full Form) degree is recognised across India. Research, calculation, and experimenting are all part of the education and training that a BSc degree gives. Both Honours and General courses can be taken towards a BSc degree. The distinction between a BSc Hons and a BSc General is that the former focuses on fundamental information about BSc while the latter combines electives and foundation courses.
